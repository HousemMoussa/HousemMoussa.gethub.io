    <h1>Hydrogen Generation Project for Liverpool John Lennon Airport</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project aims to revolutionize the energy consumption of Liverpool John Lennon Airport by generating sufficient green energy through hydrogen to power the entire airport. The project utilizes wind energy from the Burbo Bank Extension Offshore Wind Farm to produce clean hydrogen through electrolysis, which will then be used to power the airport's operations, significantly reducing its carbon footprint.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Research and Methodology</h2>
        <h3>1. Energy Requirement Analysis</h3>
        <p>A comprehensive energy audit was conducted to determine the airport's energy needs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Building energy consumption: 13,062,208 kWh/year</li>
            <li>Electric vehicle fleet (40 vehicles) energy consumption: 135,360 kWh/year</li>
            <li>Total energy requirement (including 30% safety margin): 17,156,838.4 kWh/year</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The amount of hydrogen required was calculated using the following equation:</p>
        <div class="equation">H.R. = Total Energy / Energy per kg of H₂ = 17,156,838.4 / 33.33 = 514,756.63 kg</div>

        <h3>2. Wind Energy Generation</h3>
        <p>The Burbo Bank Extension Offshore Wind Farm was selected as the primary energy source due to its proximity to the airport and its capacity to generate sufficient power. Key details include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Location: Liverpool Bay, 7 km north of the North Wirral coast</li>
            <li>Wind turbine model: Siemens SWT-3.6-120</li>
            <li>Turbine capacity: 3.6 MW</li>
            <li>Hub height: 90 m</li>
            <li>Number of turbines required: 5 (including one for redundancy)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The power output calculation considered the efficiency of wind turbines (estimated at 40%):</p>
        <div class="equation">Actual Power Output per Turbine = 3.6 MW * 0.40 = 1.44 MW</div>
        <div class="equation">Number of Turbines = Required Power Output / Actual Power Output per Turbine = 5.386 MW / 1.44 MW ≈ 4 (rounded up to 5 for redundancy)</div>

        <h3>3. Hydrogen Production through Electrolysis</h3>
        <p>The project employs water electrolysis to produce hydrogen, which offers several advantages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clean production process with no greenhouse gas emissions</li>
            <li>Utilizes renewable energy sources (wind power)</li>
            <li>Produces high-purity hydrogen suitable for various applications</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The electrolysis process follows the reaction:</p>
        <div class="equation">2H₂O → 2H₂ + O₂</div>

        <h3>4. Hydrogen Storage</h3>
        <p>The project utilizes salt caverns in Cheshire for large-scale hydrogen storage:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Location: Approximately 32 km from the airport</li>
            <li>Storage method: Gaseous hydrogen in solution-mined caverns</li>
            <li>Advantages: Large storage capacity, impermeable formations, pressure and temperature tolerance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, two underground storage tanks will be installed near the airport for immediate use.</p>

        <h3>5. Transportation Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>A dedicated pipeline system will be installed to transport hydrogen from the salt caverns to the airport:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pipeline material: High-strength steel (resistant to hydrogen embrittlement)</li>
            <li>Pipeline depth: 70 m (to cross the River Mersey safely)</li>
            <li>Length: Approximately 32 km</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
